# UI Spacing Audit

## Home Screen (above fold)
- Demo banner at top: looks fine
- Greeting + name: good spacing
- Simple/Pro toggle: good
- Total Balance label: adequate
- Balance number: good size
- P&L row: need to check alignment
- Quick action buttons (Trade/Portfolio/Markets): need to check spacing
- Watchlist section: empty state card
- Top Movers section: horizontal scroll cards
- Market News section: below fold

## Need to check:
- Scroll down for more sections
- Each screen individually
- Padding consistency across screens
